Generating a Password!

        In this project, I was tasked to use JavaScript to allow a webstie to generate a password. 
    When you click the generate a password button, it will prompt you with the length of characters 
    that you would like to have, and show a couple questions asking if you would like to add things like 
    special characters and numbers. once you confirm all of the questions, it will then create a random password 
    for you! The best part is you are able to make as many s you'd like.

Getting Started

        To get this project started, there was a repository that I pulled from that gave me the HTML, CSS, and 
    some of the starter code for the JavaScript file. 

    -side note, I actually didn't see that you could pull the starter code from the start, so I made all of the
    css and html myself at one point. You can see this in my "added html and css" push. Whoops! Later on I went back
    and pulled the proper code. 

Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    WHEN I click the button to generate a password
    THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    WHEN prompted for password criteria
    THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
    WHEN prompted for the length of the password
    THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
    THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    WHEN I answer each prompt
    THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    WHEN all prompts are answered
    THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
    WHEN the password is generated
    THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
